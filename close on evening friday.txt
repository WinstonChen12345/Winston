Adding option to close all positions on Friday evening
How to close all the open positions on Friday evening
Why to bother?

Some brokers are charging commissions when we leave opened positions over the weekend

There may be some events happening over the weekend that would let prices to slide too much...

We may want to consolidate our results, make maintenance of our trading robots etc

What will the trading robot do?

Bot will perform the following:

Add option to close positions on Friday after 23:00

Avoid opening new positions

Implementation

1. Add external variable as an option:

extern bool    closeAllOnFridays                = True; //close all orders on Friday 1hr before market closure

2. Define internal variable

bool isFridayActive = false;

3. Create the 'exit' logic that will be executed inside start() function:

  //Exit variables:
   if(closeAllOnFridays)
     {
      //check if it's Friday and 1 hr before market closure
      if(Hour()== 23 && DayOfWeek()== 5)
        {
         isFridayActive = true;
        } else
            {
             isFridayActive = false;
            }
        
     }
4. Add new conditions to close opened positions (see new condition ... || isFridayActive == true)

     if(CountPosOrders(MagicNumber,OP_BUY)>=1 && ((ExitSignal(CrossTriggered0)==2 && ExitSignal(CrossTriggered1)==1 && close_orders) || isFridayActive == true))
        { // Close Long Positions
         CloseOrderPosition(OP_BUY, OnJournaling, MagicNumber, Slippage, P, RetryInterval); 
        }
      if(CountPosOrders(MagicNumber,OP_SELL)>=1 && ((ExitSignal(CrossTriggered0)==1 && ExitSignal(CrossTriggered1)==2 && close_orders) || isFridayActive == true))
        { // Close Short Positions
         CloseOrderPosition(OP_SELL, OnJournaling, MagicNumber, Slippage, P, RetryInterval);
        }
5. Add new conditions to avoid opening new positions (see new condition !isFirdayActive)

            if(!Base && !isFridayActive && TradeAllowed && isMarketTypePolicyON && ...
